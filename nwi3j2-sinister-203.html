                            <p>I love singleton and making decks for it so I set out to make 4 different decks to get 5 wins and get my alt art Ghalta set. I finally did so I figured I'd share the decks to help promote singleton. Hope you enjoy!

Just wanted to share that for the first time since started playing Magic Arena I got to Diamond, tjohooo. Last season I was very close. I was at Platinum 1 and had one game left to get to Diamond, I won the game but before I won the season restarted so it didnt count my last game unforutnately. But this time I got to Diamond 10 hours earlier so all is good. I used from Platinum 4 - 2 Boros Feather Deck and from Platinum 2 - Diamond 4, I used a Bant Control List I found on Aetherhub

Let me start with a disclaimer: this is by no mean definitive, finished, Word of God list. We are 2 weeks in the format and I’m the first person to tell you that whatever i will write below, it might be totally incorrect just few weeks in the future. I’ve tried to pick most popular cards based on decklists i’ve seen among MTGO 5-0 lists, Online PTQ, and SCG Events last weekend. It does not mean there is no personal bias involved; for that i could just list all cards that were played and leave. 1896 1. A Terrible Night (1896/1m/Georges Méliès) 2.

Apologies for being a digital-only heathen, but I was always too poor for paper and now I'm just super excited to finally get to be able to play and tinker and share. This game is absolutely my jam and I'll be posting more jank in the future, so is it cool if I paste from Arena's export function, like I did below? I can format it any way, just please let me know what's best. Here's a screenshot. Is this better? (https://i.imgur.com/R92JT71.png) Everythi. Starting up a new Skyrim playthrough after awhile, I went through and fixed up some of my mods and stuff like that and reinstalled them (load order below) and whenever I start the game works just fine until I click the new game. After a little while the black screen shows up but it stays black and just sits there, audio can be heard in the background, and then after a moment the game just crashes, anyone able to help? (btw I'm running my game through Nexus Mod Manager), also any mods without. 
Hey all, I just wanted to say this Singleton Challenge is having me fired up for Arena even more - the rewards are FANTASTIC and it's just fun to play as everyone is playing a highly RNG deck like I am. I just wanted to share my experiences and hope it helps someone. I am terrible with deckbuilding as I do not have the creative touch that others do, so I started off by modifying current standard tier 1 decks and keeping to the similar casting costs of cards and their role in the deck.
