So I got a lot of responses to my survey which was great! This is the list of them sorted by the number of votes they got. The percentage number is how many people included that character in the roster they voted for. The bolded top 31 characters are the official roster: 1. Sub-Zero- 229 (85.4%) 2. Scorpion- 224 (83.6%) 3. Noob Saibot- 223 (83.2%) 4. Raiden- 211 (78.7%) 5. Kitana- 210 (78.4%) 6. Liu Kang- 205 (76.5%) 7. Smoke- 205 (76.5%) 8. Jade- 204 (76.1%). https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters (https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters) Real / Birth Name Code Name Cyborg Name Description Birth :- :- :- :- :- Abacus N/A N/A God of Order Orderrealm Argus N/A N/A Father of Taven, Daegon and Rain Edenia Asgaarth N/A N/A General of King Jerrod Edenia Ashrah N/A N/A Demon Netherrealm Baphomet N/A N/A Elder Demon Netherrealm Baraka N/A N/A Warrior of Outworld Outworld Bi-Han Noob Saibot ltltUnknown. Now, I know that this seems quite dumb to decipher already as MK12 won’t be for a LONG ass time in the real world. But I’d just like to think amp deduce who would most likely turn up to be within the roster with my understandable reasons. Again, if you disagree with my roster prediction or be that type of person to shit on me for saying I shouldn’t predict THIS early, then feel free to right on ahead. For the record though, if you come across as a douche, then I likely won’t respond Let's try this test: Now, you have to make your own MK roster of 30 characters, following the rules, at the end. We will see what the perfect roster is! RULES: 1- You have to pick 5 characters from MK1 (Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, Kano, Goro, Shang Tsung, Raiden) 2- You have to pick 5 of the new characters from MK2 (Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Reptile, Baraka, Jax, Kintaro, Kung Lao, Smoke, Noob Saibot, Shao Kahn) 3- You have to pick 4 of the new characters ~~Ashrah~~ Baraka - Update Bi-Han/Sub-Zero I/Noob Saibot - Update ~~Blaze~~ ~~Bo' Rai Cho~~ Cassie Cage Cetrion Chameleon ~~Cyrax~~ D'Vorah ~~Daegon~~ ~~Dairou~~ ~~Darrius~~ ~~Drahmin~~ Ermac Erron Black Ferra/Torr Frost Fujin Geras Goro Havik Hotaru ~~Hsu Hao~~ Jacqui Briggs Jade Jarek Jax Briggs Johnny Cage Kabal Kai Kano Kenshi Khameleon Kintaro Kira Kitana Kobra Kollector Kotal Kahn Kronika 
\ Cracks Knuckles\ Okay. So, countless eons ago everything and everyone and all the space that existed was combined into something called the One Being. Everything except the Elder Gods on which the one being fed. It was a kind of sentient life form with supreme power. Think Azathoth from the Lovecraft mythos. Eventually, the elder gods found a way to beat the One Being by splitting reality into a bunch of different realms and hiding a magical artifact called a kamidogu Basically, all the 3D Era kharacters had the same problem: That Era was always in the shadow of the Trilogy Era, which was very hard to surpass, considering also that Midway has to keep up with the rest of the 3D fighting games in that time and bring new things to the table in a certain amount of time. With this said, we got games that had a decent general story, but very unpolished in a lot of aspects, one of them, the kharacters. Who of those were wasted thanks to this? # Respect Blaze! (https://imgur.com/a/rUnVCF3) gt"Finally free, I have emerged to discover beings whose power and number exceed that which the realms can sustain. I have sounded the call. The sleeping brother will soon awaken." ## Backstory and Overview One of the most powerful entities in the Mortal Kombat universe, Blaze is a firespawn created by the Edenian sorceress Delia (https://gfycat.com/FlusteredGeneralEmeraldtreeskink) whose objective was to watch. 
So here's my guess for the release roster for MK11.I also saw a dialogue between Raiden and Scorpion that got me curious and wondering, in which Raiden tells Scorpion a threat is coming from Chaosrealm, after Scorpion asks him why did he seek out his clan (maybe to defend Earthrealm from this threat): https://youtu.be/iszW4oRBqXE?t=102 (https://youtu.be/iszW4oRBqXE?t=102) On to the kharacters -- KONFIRMED -- Scorpion • Sub-Zero • Raiden • Sonya Blade • Kano • Geras (New) • Skarlett • Baraka. Mortal Kombat 2: 5 Returnees Returning from MK1: Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Liu Kang Missing From MK1: Sonya, Kano Mortal Kombat 3: 3 Returnees Returning from MK2: Shang Tsung, Jax, Kung Lao Missing From MK2: Reptile, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka Mortal Kombat 4: 2 Returnees Returning from MK3/Trilogy: Noob, Goro Missing from MK3: Sindel, Stryker, Cyrax, Sektor, Nightwolf, Sheeva, Kabal Missing from UMK3/Trilogy: Rain, Jade, Ermac, Smoke, Kintaro, Motaro. I want to start out by saying I am super excited for MK11 and thing it looks absolutely fantastic, gameplay, roster, and story! I am super excited for the Kombat Kasts to start!! I just wanted to hold a discussion about NRS (previously Midway's) poor track record of establishing a new face to the MK series via its roster. It seems that time and time again, the series attempts to wipe clean the current slate of characters or events only to turn back on it the next title. This isn't meant # Respect the Mortal Kombat Universe! (https://imgur.com/a/tvKXc9U) ### Introduction gt"MORTAL KOMBAAAT!!" On October 8, 1992, the world was changed forever: Mortal Kombat hit the arcades. Over the years the series has spawned 11 mainline series games, several spinoff titles, multiple comic book series, two live-action movies (each with their own novelizations), an animated movie that went direct to video, an animated series, a live-action series, a live-action webseries Cracks Knuckles Okay. So, countless eons ago everything and everyone and all the space that existed was combined into something called the One Being. Everything except the Elder Gods on which the one being fed. It was a kind of sentient life form with supreme power. Think Azathoth from the Lovecraft mythos. Eventually, the elder gods found a way to beat the One Being by splitting reality into a bunch of different realms and hiding a magical artifact called a kamidogu in each one. That's. We know, that premiere skins are going to be a thing. Now with Kano revealed my guess is that we'll get Frost skin for Sub Zero, Kira skin for Kano and maby Kai skin for Kung Lao (not yet revealed, but certain imo). What do you think about that? Do you suspect some other characters would be put in the game as skins. Alive Sub Zero Raiden Scorpion Reptile Sonya Blade Johnny Cage Kano Goro Jax Sheeva Ermac Rain Chameleon / Khameleon Fujin Sareena Tanya Tremor Frost Blaze Kenshi Bo’ Rai Cho Onaga Kira Taven Daegon Cassie Cage Jacqui Briggs Takeda Kung Jin Erron Black D’Vorah Kotal Kahn Li Mei Shujinko Ferra and Torr amp#x200B; Revenant Noob Saibot Jade Kabal Kitana Kung Lao Liu Kang Nightwolf Sindel Smoke Stryker amp#x200B; Dead Motaro I personally feel that NRS should make a game similar to killer instinct where they have different seasons of characters into the game for example As a side game not a main game Season 1 - 20 Fighters - Scorpion - Subzero - Kitana - Liu Kang - Kung Lao - Baraka - Reptile - Jade - Mileena - Sonya - Johnny - Rain - Smoke - Ermac - Cyrax - Sektor - Shang Tsung - Quan Chi - Noob - Raiden - Khrome (PREORDER BONUS) Season 2 - 10 Fighters (4mo mo later) - Frost - Fujin - Taven - Daegon - Jacqui. Most of the community anyway. I know now is a bit late as MK11 is mostly finalised, but they really should look at this for MK12 if they don't do everything now. BIGGER ROSTER!- variations vs 3 times that many fighters? Ask most fans, they will chose more characters! KONQUEST MODE in the Deception Shujinko and Armageddon Taven style. PLAY AS "VILLAIN CHARACTERS" IN STORY MODE!- no more jobbers!!! TEAM MODE! 3D ERA COSTUMES! (and I might add good scripts!) MOTOR or CHESS KOMBAT would 
So I had a lot of time on my hands at work and built a list of 72 (which includes all characters) ranked from worst to best. Have a look and as a disclaimer THIS BASED ON MY OPINION AND WHAT I CAN REMEMBER FROM THE OLDER GAMES. ALSO CONTRIBUTION TO THE MAIN STORY I'd love to start a discussion and debate but be nice were all MK fans in the end.
